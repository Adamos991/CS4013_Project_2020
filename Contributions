Contributions:

Design:
The four of us worked on the design within a discord call for basically a whole day, wondering how we were going to do this. 
We all contributed equally to the design side of things and we ended up with CRC Cards and a UML diagram that was very similar, although
not 100% the same as the final product. We all contributed to the conversation while Gabriel wrote the CRC Cards on a live stream and 
Padraig drew our UML diagram.

Coding:
While we all had different roles to play a part on, we all also largely contributed to every class and every part of the code, from 
actually writing it, to then reviewing it and editing it if we found mistakes, to the point where we all agreed that it was simply unfair
to actually give our different classes and methods an author, and upon trying to do so we realized we were just making up authors that
simply did not make sense. Our initial roles however included Adam getting the Owner to coopertae with the Property, in order to then cooperate
with the PropertyTax. Bart's role was to store all of these in CSV files, then be able to read from these CSV files and write to these CSV
files. Padraig's role was to make the code cooperate with the CLI, while Gabe had to make it cooperate with the GUI, but we all did
bits and pieces of code in each of these roles and didn't really stick to them, and we also found that it worked very well as our
final product turned out pretty good.

Documentation:
We documented everything using JavaDocs at the very end, once again hopping into a call and just giving each other classes to 
write documents on. We all understood each part of the code as we all worked on it together so it didn't matter who got which class.

Testing:
We tested everything along the way, we didn't really run specific tests but rather just ran our program and saw whether it worked, if it did
we were happy, and if it didn't then we fixed it.
